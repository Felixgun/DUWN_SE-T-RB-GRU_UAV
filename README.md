## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**DUWN_T-SE-RB-GRU_UAV** is a deep learning framework designed to perform **gesture recognition** using signals captured by a **Distributed Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Network**, enabling **real-time UAV control**. The system leverages a hybrid architecture combining **Transformer**, **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)** modules, **Residual connections**, and a **Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU)** to enhance temporal and spatial signal understanding.

It supports:
- Model **training and testing**
- Real-time **inference on PC**
- Optimized **inference on Jetson Xavier NX**
- Full UAV flight control via **Jetson-based inference**
